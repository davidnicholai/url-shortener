## Notes

- I chose to go with Ruby on Rails for the following reasons: it's good for rapid prototyping (fast support for CRUD), easy to setup & dockerize, basic familiarity
- Will run my test environment on my Linux VM then use VS Code to connect to it remotely and SSH port forwarding to connect w my browser
- Started working at 10am
- Took a break at 11am. Resumed at 12
- 12:30 to 1: Asked Boggs about indexing
- 1:00 to 1:30: Implemented half of the stuff. Will cook lunch. Resumed at 2:30
